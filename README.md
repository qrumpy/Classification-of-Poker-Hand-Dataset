<p id="description">This program presents an application of pattern recognition and classification using the Poker Hand dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Data Warehouse. The data represents five-card poker hands and each card is characterized by two features: color and rank. A classification model was trained on the data using the Random Forest algorithm and the accuracy and performance of the model were evaluated. The model performed reasonably well in classifying poker hands with an accuracy of 75.3%.</p><br>
